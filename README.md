![Student Performance](images/student_performance_plot.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project exploring the factors influencing students' scores. The analysis focuses on two main factors: parents' education levels and distance from school. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy for data visualization and analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about students' scores along with their parents' education levels and the distance of their homes from the school.

## Analysis

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the relationship between students' scores and the factors under consideration.

3. Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests are conducted to assess the significance of the relationships observed.

4. Conclusion: Conclusions are drawn based on the findings from the analysis.
